## Logs

On the Logs tab of a specific trigger, you can view all historical executions of that trigger and the object they acted on. Clicking on the relevant part of the row (i.e. issue number) brings you directly into the object, where you can see when in the Activity Log the trigger fired.

## History

By toggling the version history for a specific trigger, view all historical versions to understand when and why changes to your business workflows were made.

Use trigger history to:

1. Understand why changes in a workflow were made and who made them
2. Debug unexpected behavior by understanding the state of a trigger at a point in time
3. Rollback to a previous state to quickly iterate on your business process

## Time Delay Queue

Triggers can have time delays as part of their control flow. With the time delay queue inspector you can see items that are part of the queue to be evaluated.
