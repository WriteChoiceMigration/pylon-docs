Pylon has 5 statuses for issues: `New`, `On You`, `On Customer`, `On Hold`, and `Closed`. Each has special behavior in how it functions individually and interacts with other aspects of Pylon.

## Categories

### New

New indicates that an issue has not yet had a response by your team since it has started being tracked in Pylon.

When you receive a new email issue, Chat Widget issue, etc. it will almost always start in New.

### On You

On You indicates the next action on the issue needs to be taken by your team.

Pylon automatically uses AI to determine whether next action is needed by your team or by the customer when there is new activity on an issue. This means if a team member responds to a customer issue directly in Slack, email, etc, Pylon will still move the issue to the appropriate status without them taking manual action.

### On Customer

On Customer indicates that the next action on the issue needs to be taken by the customer. Issues are typically in this status when you are waiting for a response, acknowledgement, or additional information from the customer.

### On Hold

On Hold indicates that an issue is pending an action external to Pylon. Issues are typically in this status when they are waiting on a bug fix from engineering.

If using Pylon's [ticketing integrations](/pylon-docs/integrations/ticketing), issues will automatically be moved to on hold when a corresponding unfinished engineering ticket is linked to a Pylon issue. Issues are also automatically moved to on hold when they are snoozed.

Issues are automatically moved out of on hold when there is new public activity on the issue.

### Closed

Closed indicates an issue has been resolved. In Pylon, closed issues can be reopened if there is new activity on the issue, for example, a customer in Slack sending a new message into a thread.


## Custom Statuses

Use custom statuses to further personalize issue workflows to your business. For example, you can make a "Waiting on Engineering" status in the On Hold category to give more details to anyone viewing the Kanban board.

Custom statuses can be used anywhere statuses are used â€” they show up as separate Kanban columns/List rows, and can be set with keyboard shortcuts in macros, triggers, and more.

Custom statuses + their icon colors can be adjusted on the [Issue Statuses](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/issue-statuses) page in Settings.

## Setting Status

The status of an issue can be set explicitly by your team by:

* Dragging the issue card on the Kanban Board
* Selecting issue cards or rows and bulk setting their status
* Clicking on the status to choose from the dropdown when a specific issue is open
* Using the keyboard shortcut `s` when an issue is open

You can also use features like [Triggers](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers) or [Macros](/pylon-docs/platform/macros) to automatically set the status of an issue as part of a workflow.
