## Creating Roles

<Info>
Role-based access control can only be configured by Admins.
</Info>

Visit the Settings page and look for Roles to set up new custom roles.

1. Create a new role and select the permissions you wish to grant to that role.

    <Frame>
    <img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="high" height="324" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/973b122b.png" width="1520"/>
    </Frame>

2. For data like Issues, you can create roles that have access to a subset of this data.

    Use the filters under Issues to designate which set of Issues that role will have permissions to view. For example, create a `Security` role that is only able to view email issues to your security email.

3. Save the role.

## Default Roles

### Member Role

Members have access to most features of the platform. Typically anyone that needs edit access within Pylon should be granted the Member role.

### Admin Role

Admins have additional capabilities beyond those of regular members. These include:

* Access to workspace-level settings
* Access to security settings
* Access to billing settings
* Ability to install and uninstall apps
* Ability to delete issues and accounts
* Access to powerful developer features like creating API tokens
* Permission to invite other users as admins

## User Management

On the Users page, apply roles to existing users or invite new users to Pylon with your new role. You can:

* Select a role from the dropdown for an individual employee
* Bulk select invited users and change their role
* Hit "Invite User" to invite a new user to Pylon with a particular role

From the Users page, you can also bulk add an employee to linked Slack channels, which is a particularly useful feature for new members joining your team!
