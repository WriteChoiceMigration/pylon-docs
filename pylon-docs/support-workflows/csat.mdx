## Setup

1. Visit the [Surveys page](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/surveys) (Settings > Workflows > Surveys) and hit "Create Survey"
2. Select from one of the available templates or create your own rules for when CSAT surveys should be sent. CSAT can be collected over Slack, email, in-app, etc.

    <Frame>
    <img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="high" height="232" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/c3a7c954.png" width="572"/>
    </Frame>

3. Customize when CSAT is sent out within the trigger. For example, easily disable CSAT for certain customers that express fatigue with surveys, or for certain types of issues.

### Behavior

* The CSAT survey is sent to the customer who opened the issue.
* Multiple CSAT surveys can be collected for a single issue. If you want to collect only one per issue, you should make sure to add a tag (i.e. "CSAT collected") the first time you collect a survey to be used as an exclude filter in the trigger.
* CSAT surveys are on a 1-5 point scale with an optional space for free form feedback.

Configure additional behavior of the CSAT survey by going to Settings > Workflows > CSAT > Config.

CSAT data is visible on a dedicated tab within Analytics. CSAT for an individual issue is also available on the page for that issue.
