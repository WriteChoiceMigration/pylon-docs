## Rubrics

Create [rubrics](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/ai-controls/qa?tab=rubric) to enforce that processes are being followed on the agent and issue level.

## Review

When issues are closed, they will be evaluated according to the rubrics you defined, allowing you to see both issue and user level evaluations.

On the [AI Issue QA](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/ai-controls/qa?tab=issues) page, you can view all evaluated issues and filter by those not meeting expectations.
