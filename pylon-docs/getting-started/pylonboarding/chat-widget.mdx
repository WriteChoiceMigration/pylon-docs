## Overview

Pylon’s Chat Widget lets you deliver fast, contextual support directly inside your product. It’s designed to meet users where they are, while giving your team the automation, structure, and reporting you need to manage support at scale.

## Use cases

* In-product enablement
    + Allow users to ask questions and get answers directly in your product. Add AI as a first line of defense. Use the [JavaScript API](/pylon-docs/chat-widget/javascript-api) to customize behavior.
* Structured ticket submission
    + Let users open structured requests via embedded forms if support is not available.


## Best practices

* Customize branding and appearance
    + Use your brand colors
* Use forms for common, structured requests like bug reports or feature feedback
* Differentiated support experience
    + Show or hide the widget or ability to chat based on user properties like tier or stage
    + Display different quick links for users using different parts of the product
* Customize with [JavaScript API](/pylon-docs/chat-widget/javascript-api)
    + Toggle the chat when the user clicks a "Need Help" button within your UI
    + Autofill the user's first message based on an error they ran into
    + Embed custom metadata from the page to make resolution easier for your team
* Sync to Slack for smaller teams
    + Sync chats to Slack to respond to customers and get visibility directly in Slack
* Monitor chat performance in [Analytics](/pylon-docs/reporting-and-analytics/analytics) to understand response times, AI deflection rate, and customer experience
