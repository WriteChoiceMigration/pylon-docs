Create views for:

* Books of business for different account managers or CSMs
* Accounts that are at risk or have upsell opportunities based on a wide array of signals
* Customers with revenue > $5,000 who onboarded in the last month and their progress against the onboarding [Project Templates](/pylon-docs/account-intelligence/tasks-and-projects/project-templates)

## Spreadsheet

Use the spreadsheet view to quickly make edits to fields on accounts and visualize account fields.

Customize your columns by choosing fields you've set up on your Accounts to display. Columns can be reordered or resized. Finalize your view before saving into a view for yourself or your team.

You can also manipulate your view with Account-based filter fields, similar to how you would with Issue [Filters](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/issues/views#filters).

Here's an example of a custom Accounts view set to filter for current customers:

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="high" height="882" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/211b19e5.png" width="2516"/>
</Frame>

### Aggregations

Add column level aggregations, for example to sum revenue across a book or count the number of accounts that have a field filled.

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="1030" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/1bb8a443.png" width="668"/>
</Frame>

### Formatting

Create conditional formatting rules to change font color cell color based on a range of conditions.

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="1182" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/6db87fdf.png" width="2514"/>
</Frame>
