## Setup

Click into the App Directory from your Pylon dashboard and then click on the Asana integration to view setup instructions.

## Usage

### Creating Asana Tasks

From a Pylon issue, you’ll see an Asana Details module in the sidebar. You can find an existing issue by copying in a link to it directly, or searching by keywords.

To create a new task, select a project and click Create.

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="high" height="170" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/a6b246ec.png" width="416"/>
</Frame>

Your form should popup. We’ve copied the Pylon ID into your clipboard for you to copy into the Pylon Issue ID field. The first time you create a ticket, you will need to allow clipboard browser permissions for Pylon.

Copy the ID into that field.

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="548" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/b5242302.png" width="839"/>
</Frame>

And you’re done! Notice how the ticket has a Pylon native module embedded right there so your product and engineering can also get context on the Pylon side of things.

</Frame>

### Linking Asana Tasks

You can also search for an Asana task by keywords, or directly paste in a link to the task.

### Inside Pylon

Comments in Asana sync as internal notes to Pylon.

In addition, when a Asana task is completed, the Pylon issue receives a notification and gets moved to "On You", letting you know to tell the customer about completed change.
