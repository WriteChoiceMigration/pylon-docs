By default, authentication for your customers to access gated content in your knowledge base is handled via a one-time passcode sent to their email on login.

Using Customer Authentication, you can instead implement unified login across the knowledge base and your web application. This means when customers are logged in to your dashboard, they'll also seamlessly be logged into your Pylon knowledge base (and customer portal).
