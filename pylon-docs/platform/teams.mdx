Create teams with assignment rules, then utilize them to set up targeted issue views and workflows, and analyze metrics relevant to different teams.

## Setup

### Team Creation

Create teams from the [teams page](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/teams/management) and add members.

Teams can also contain other teams as subteams. For example, you may have a broad Support team with different subteams representing various geographic regions.

## Usage

Teams can be used across Pylon as a filter value in views, triggers, macros, and more. Issues can also be assigned to a team manually from the UI, via the API, or via triggers and macros with the "Set issue team" action.

You can also set up complex [assignment rules](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/assignment-rules) to define behavior for what happens when an issue is assigned to a specific team.
