## Overview

Tags are labels that can be added to issues or accounts to group them together. Tags can be created dynamically directly from an issue or account by typing a new value into the tags field on an Account or Issue. Each tag has both a name and a color for easy visual categorization.

<Info>
Use [custom fields](/pylon-docs/platform/custom-fields) for more structured data collection! Tag options can be created on the fly — so use tags for quick and dirty labeling and workflows.

## Usage

Add a tag to an individual issue or account by clicking into the record and finding the tags field. From there, either select one or more existing tags values to apply or type a new value to create and apply a new tag.

Tags can also be applied in bulk by selecting a set of issues or accounts, then applying a tag from the tag menu that pops up at the bottom of the page.

Once applied, tags can be used across Pylon in other places like views, triggers, macros, and more.

After they're created, Tags can be managed from the Issue Tags or Account Tags pages in settings — this is where you'll be able to edit or delete tags, change their colors, and see how many issues and accounts they are associated with.
