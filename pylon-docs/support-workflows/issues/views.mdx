## Kanban

The Kanban view allows you to see issues laid out in a grid. Pylon's standard Kanban view organizes issues by status.

* Drag an issue between columns to change its status
* Change the assignee directly from the kanban view by clicking on the assignee avatar
* Greyed out cards indicate issues that have already been viewed by your user
* Cards with a red dot indicate new activity since you last viewed an issue

</Frame>

## List

The List view allows you to view issues in a list with columns.

* Customize the columns that are visible in the list view
* Change the assignee directly from the list view by clicking on the assignee avatar
* Greyed out rows indicate issues that have already been viewed
* Rows with a red dot indicate new activity since you last view that issue

</Frame>

## Filters

Select filters to apply to narrow down the set of visible issues. Issues can be filtered by a variety of default fields across issues, accounts, or contacts as well as any custom fields you've created. By default, filters are AND'ed together, meaning only issues meeting all specified filters conditions will appear.

Filters can also be combined in advanced ways using Filter Groups. With Filter Groups, different groupings of filter conditions can be combined with AND or OR operators.
