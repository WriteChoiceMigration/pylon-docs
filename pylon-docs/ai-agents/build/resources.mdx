First, connect any external knowledge into Pylon through the Training Data ingestion process.

By default, your Pylon knowledge base is always optionally available as a resource. Pylon can also:

* Crawl any public URL (tree of URLs) or ingest individual webpage URLs
* Handle uploaded files like PDFs, CSVs, JSONs, etc.

Sources can be marked as public or internal depending on what workflows they should be used in. Individual AI Agents can be given access to different subsets of resources depending on use case.

Once you've set up all your resources, navigate to Settings > Agents > [Specific AI Agent] > Resources, and grant access to the relevant resources for that AI agent.
