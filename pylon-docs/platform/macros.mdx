## Setup

Visit the Settings Page and look for Macros to set up new macros.

1. Set up a templated response using dynamic variables. When a macro is used, this text will be pre-filled in the editor, and all youâ€™ll have to do is hit send!
2. Set up actions that will be executed when the macro is used, such as adding a certain tag to an issue (for tracking and [Analytics](/pylon-docs/broadcasts/analytics)) or setting the state to closed.
3. Set up filters to determine when a macro will be available. For example, you can have different macros available for your team to use on Slack vs. Chat Widget questions.
4. Create macros for your whole organization, your team, or just yourself.

## Organization

Macros can be placed into different groups for better organization. When executing macros from an issue, you'll be able to click into groups as well to find a specific macro.

## Usage

Once you set up some Macros, you can access them from inside your text editor on an issue by hitting the lightning bolt or with the shortcut `m` .

Here you can search for macros by name and also see a preview of the macro before hitting send. This gives you the opportunity to make any tweaks that might be needed before it's sent.
