## Setup

From the [Support Hours page](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/support-hours), build schedules for support hours. Support hours has support for:

* Multiple schedules, each in different timezones

* Default and custom holidays

* Schedules assignable to individual customers or sets of customers

## Usage

### SLAs

Support hours affect how [SLAs](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/slas) are calculated - SLA timers only increment during business hours.

### Triggers

Within [Triggers](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers), a Support Hours filter is available. This can be used to setup workflows like auto-responders when customers submit requests outside of your working hours.

### Analytics

Many analytics, like time to first response or time to resolution, can be viewed including and excluding support hours.
