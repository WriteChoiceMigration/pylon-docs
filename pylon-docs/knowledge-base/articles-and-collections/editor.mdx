Pylon's knowledge base editor is a "what you see if what you get" (WYSIWG) style editor. This means your customers will see content exactly as you type it.

Content is added in the form of **blocks**, which are individual elements in the article. Blocks can be dragged around to reorder them or deleted.

To get started, type `/` in your knowledge editor to see what blocks are available.

<Info>
The knowledge base editor also supports markdown-style syntax. For example, you can type "#" to start a Header 1, ">" to start a blockquote, etc.

## Blocks

Currently supported blocks in Pylon's article editor are:

* All common rich text like bolds, italics, underline, strikethrough, inline code, links, etc.
* Headers, with 3 different sizes
* Text justification
* Numbered and bulleted lists
* Accordions
* Callouts, with customizable icon and color
* Code blocks
    + Tabs with filenames and syntax highlighting in 20+ languages
* Blockquotes
* Native relative links to other knowledge base pages
* Tables, with header rows and colored cells
* Inline images, with resizing, justification options, captions, alt text, etc. options
* Embedded videos, like Loom and YouTube
* Embedded downloadable files
* Custom embeds, like Scribe and Arcade (or any site that supports embeds)
* Horizontal dividers
* Internal notes, special content that is only visible when your team member is viewing the article

While typing in a block, you can highlight text for options to edit that text's format within the block or add links. You can also press the `+` key to add a relative link to another article in your KB.
