There are three access levels that can be granted to your customers' users.

### No Access

End users with no access will not be able to login to the portal. You or customer admins can revoke access for a user at any time.

### Member

Members are able to see and manage just tickets they have submitted in the portal - not tickets submitted by their coworkers.

Members also cannot change the roles of their teammates and cannot invite additional teammates into the portal.

### Admin

Admins can see and manage tickets submitted across their organization.

Admins can also change the role of their teammates and invite additional users into the customer portal.
