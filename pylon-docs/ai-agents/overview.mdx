## How to think about AI Agents

You can think about AI Agents as an extension of your team, users who can be assigned to issues. They can be used for many things, including:

* Handling of questions based on knowledge base or documentation content
* Initial information collection from customer
* Gathering of context internally for your team
* End-to-end resolution of issue

You can use AI Agents to attempt to automate the pieces of your workflow you want to - **expect it to be an iterative process** to identify the best workflows to automate, and to build your skills in instructing the agent.
