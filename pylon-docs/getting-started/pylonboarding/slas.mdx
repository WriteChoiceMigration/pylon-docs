## Overview

SLAs (Service Level Agreements) help ensure timely, consistent support by defining how quickly your team should respond to and resolve customer issues. With Pylon, you can customize SLAs to match the expectations of different customer segments, prioritize critical issues, and automate reminders or escalations when targets are missed.

Pylon supports three types of SLAs:

* **First Response Time** – The time it takes for your team to respond to the first customer message
* **Next Response Time** – The time between a customer’s follow-up and your next reply
* **Resolution Time** – The total time it takes to fully resolve an issue

All SLAs can be configured to respect business hours and customized by priority, customer tier, and more.

## Use Cases

* Tiered Support
    + Set stricter SLAs for enterprise accounts and more flexible targets for standard users
* Priority-Based Routing
    + Assign faster SLAs to issues marked as “Urgent” or related to critical workflows
* Proactive Escalations
    + Automatically alert managers or trigger escalation workflows when a deadline is missed
* Time-Sensitive Channels
    + Create different SLAs for Slack, in-app chat, or email based on the nature of each channel
* Resolution Reporting
    + Track SLA performance over time to identify trends and improve team efficiency


## Best Practices

* Use Templates to Start
    + Begin with a prebuilt SLA template and customize it to fit your needs
* Set Support Hours
    + Enable [Support Hours](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/support-hours) to prevent off-hours SLA breaches
* Enable Notifications
    + Set up breach alerts via Slack or email to keep your team aware and responsive
* Review SLA Breaches
    + Use Analytics dashboards to analyze performance and fine-tune thresholds and routing over time
