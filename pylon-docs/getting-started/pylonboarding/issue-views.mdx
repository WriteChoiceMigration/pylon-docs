Views in your Pylon Dashboard

## Overview

Views in Pylon help you organize and manage customer conversations across Slack, email, in-app chat, and more. With Views, you can:

* Focus on what matters most by filtering Issues and Tickets by status, priority, assignee, or source
* Create team dashboards tailored to specific functions or workflows
* Support triage at scale by visualizing queues clearly
* Personalize your day with saved filters and layouts for your role
* Standardize processes across support and success teams

Whether youâ€™re managing hundreds of issues a day or just want a cleaner workflow, Views help you stay focused.


## Setup

## Use cases

* Individual Queue
    + A *Kanban* view filtered by `Assignee = Current User` to see all of your issues
* Support Queue
    + A *List* view filtered by `Team = Support`, sorted by *priority* for quick triage.
* Feature Requests
    + A view filtered to `Question Type = Feature Request` to view issues [AI labeled as feature requests](https://docs.usepylon.com/pylon-docs/platform/custom-fields#ai-autofill)


## Best practices

* Start simple
    + Begin with a few broad views filtered down by team, account owner, or assignee
* Hide extra views
    + Hide views that you don't use
* Use sharing wisely
    + Keep views private by default, but share important ones to drive alignment across teams.
