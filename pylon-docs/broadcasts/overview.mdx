## What is a Broadcast?

Think of broadcasts as a marketing campaign or announcement. Build an audience and send out a message in bulk automatically to many Slack channels at once. After sending, Pylon will track all engagements including reactions, replies, and link clicks across.

Send broadcasts about:

* New feature releases
* Upcoming events like webinars or conferences
* Time-sensitive situations like outages or scheduled downtime
* Surveys to collect product feedback or NPS
