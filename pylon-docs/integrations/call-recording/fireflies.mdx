## Setup

Click into the App Directory from your Pylon dashboard and then click on the Fireflies integration to view setup instructions. Fireflies will need to be connected to Pylon through Zapier, so you must also have a Zapier account. For more setup instructions, [see here](https://support.usepylon.com/articles/7242599402-how-do-i-integrate-fireflies-ai-with-pylon).

## Usage

New Fireflies calls will automatically get ingested and associated with the right account.

Fireflies calls will be used as data context for many Pylon features like [Ask AI](/pylon-docs/platform/ask-ai), Account Copilot, and Account Widgets and be visibility on the activity timeline for accounts and related issues.
