Once you select where to create the issue and fine tune your message (details below), click the "Create Issue" button again in the top right to finalize and post.

#### Internal Only

Create an issue that is only visible internally to your team. Manually set the account of the issue as the customer account to attribute work to the proper customer.

This is best used when:

* Tracking work from a customer call
* Tracking fully internal work on behalf of a customer, i.e. requests made from internal team members

#### Email

Kick off an email to a customer or set of customers that will be tracked as an issue in Pylon. Use CC and BCC to loop in relevant additional stakeholders.

#### Slack

Kick off a proactive issue into a shared Slack channel. This will post a message into your configured shared channel with the customer and start an issue tracked in Pylon.

#### Microsoft Teams

Kick off a proactive issue into a Teams channel. This will post a message into your configured Teams channel with the customer and start an issue tracked in Pylon.

#### Chat Widget

Kick off a proactive issue to a user over chat. This will pop your message out from the user's chat, allowing them to click and respond.
