## Statuses

Users can be one of three statuses: active, busy, or out of office.

## Setting Status

Users can set their status by clicking their profile and then selecting Change status. Depending on the status they select, they will have additional options they can configure, like how long they will be in that status as well as whether to reassign their issues.

Admins can also set status on behalf of users from Settings > General > Users.

An assignee's status can also be used as a filter in triggers, views, etc. This can allow you to control specific behavior for workflows when a user is active/busy/out of office.

<Info>
A non-active user (busy or out of office) by default will not get assigned to issues as part of your [team assignment rules](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/assignment-rules). This can be customized as part of setting the assignment rule!
