## Setup

Click into the [Apps Directory](https://app.usepylon.com/apps) on the sidebar in Pylon, then click on the Slack integration to install the app. You must be a Slack admin to perform the installation.

### Multiple Workspaces

Pylon can track customer messages across multiple Slack workspaces! Just connect each workspace individually from the Apps Directory and [enable Pylon in the relevant channels](/pylon-docs/getting-started/channel-configuration).

For example, if you have a [Slack Community](/pylon-docs/integrations/chat/slack/slack-community), Pylon can track common user questions!

## Usage

<Info>
Messages from Slack are automatically sent to Pylonâ€™s [Views](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/issues/views) and [Internal Threads](/pylon-docs/integrations/chat/slack/editor) for tracking and response.
</Info>

### Customer Slack Channels

<Info>
Pylon can track messages in public or private channels, as well as Slack Connect channels initiated by your customer.
</Info>

Pylon watches for customer issues in connected customer Slack channels and automatically bundles together relevant messages and creates tracked issues within Pylon.

### Internal Collaboration

With [Internal Threads](/pylon-docs/integrations/chat/slack/editor), Pylon gives your team an internal place to collaborate on customer issues and take quick actions directly in Slack.

This allows users without Pylon access to collaborate on issues without leaving Slack while still syncing the conversation across Slack and Pylon.

### Workflows

Pylon has lots of customizations on how your team and customers can engage in support, onboarding, and other workflows through Slack.

Examples include:

* Customizing the in-Slack experience when a customer opens a ticket, like sending an automated message when a customer messages off hours
* Automatically setting bookmarks in Slack channels for quick links to documentation, tutorials, onboarding guides, etc.
* Collecting structured fields, like the priority of an issue, when a customer raises and issue from Slack
* Easily add new team members to subsets of your customer channels

### Use of AI

Pylon uses AI technology, which may occasionally generate inaccurate or incomplete responses. Users should verify important information and use their judgment when relying on AI-generated content.
