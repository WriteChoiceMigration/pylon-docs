* Social icons in footer

* Brand color

* Banner image

* Page properties like favicon and HTML title

## Custom Domain

## Custom Code

Inject custom scripts from the Code page. For example, a script for Google Analytics to collect page views or a tracking pixel for collecting intent data from visitors.

All public articles in your knowledge base will be automatically made SEO friendly and indexable by search engines and crawlers.

You can also provide an OpenGraph image to use in social previews.
