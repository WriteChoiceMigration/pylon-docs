The Pylon API uses [Bearer](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750#section-2.1) authentication. This means youâ€™ll need to pass your API token in the header of your request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

<Info>
Generate an API token in the [Pylon dashboard](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/api-tokens).
</Info>

Once creating a token, you can hit the [`/me`](/pylon-docs/developer/api/api-reference/me) endpoint to retrieve details about your organization to confirm your token is working as expected.

<Info>
Actions performed by the token will show up with name of the token.
