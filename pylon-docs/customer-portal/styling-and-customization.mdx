## Styling

From the Customer Portal settings [page](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/customer-portal) you can customize the look of the portal including:

* Brand colors
* Header and footer categories and links
* Horizontal logo

<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="high" height="628" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/c196ebc6.png" width="2316"/>
</Frame>

## Settings

Choose default behavior for portal access as new users interact with your team. From the portal settings [page](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/customer-portal) you can customize whether new customer users automatically get an invitation email to the portal, whether they even get access, and what their access level is. You can also use the API to create customers users and grant access to the portal as part of your user provisioning process.

## Data

#### Ticket Fields

Choose which fields on your tickets are visible and changeable by users. For example, surface a Category or Priority field that users can view and modify.

</Frame>

#### Forms

You can also have different set of ticket forms available to different sets of portal users. For example, if you have accounts on different tiers see different forms.

#### Issue Visibility

By default, new tickets submitted by users will be visible in the portal. You have control on the ticket level to show or not show particular tickets, as well as the title the ticket shows up with.

Click into any issue in Pylon and find the Customer Portal Settings module in the sidebar to change the visibility or title of an individual issue or in bulk by selecting a set of issues. You can also set up a [Trigger](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers) to automatically set the portal visibility of certain types of issues.

<Info>
Customers can view and manage tickets from across Slack, Email, Chat Widget, and more directly in the portal!
