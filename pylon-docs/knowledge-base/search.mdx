Customers can search for answers to their questions directly in the knowledge base. Public, unauthenticated users' searches will run against all articles marked as **public**. Logged in users searches will run against all articles marked as **public** and articlesmarked as **customer**, if the logged in user fits within the specified filters for that article.

Internal users can visit the knowledge base and [articles marked](/pylon-docs/knowledge-base/articles-and-collections#visibility) as **internal** and unlisted articles will also be visible and accessible via search.

<Info>
Within your Knowledge Base analytics, you can see a list of all previous search queries and how many results they brought up.

Use this to inform you on what documentation to write!

## **Federated Search**

For customers using [AI agents](/pylon-docs/ai-agents/overview), your knowledge base search will be **federated** across your public training data. This means users' searches will pull up native search results across connected sources.

A search query with results from the knowledge base, documentation site, and marketing page.

Your team can search for knowledge base articles using [Command Search](/pylon-docs/platform/command-search) or from the issue detail view directly by clicking on the knowledge base icon in the sidebar of an issue.

## AI Search

When your customer asks a question in the KB search, Pylon's AI will attempt to answer their question directly as the first search results, and cite its sources.

Note: this is currently only supported when directly searching on the Knowledge Base. AI summaries are not yet supported when searching through the Knowledge Base chat widget module.
