## Setup

Click into the App Directory from your Pylon dashboard and then click on the Grain integration to view setup instructions. Grain will need to be connected to Pylon through Zapier, so you must also have a Zapier account. For more setup instructions, [see here](https://support.usepylon.com/articles/2213769595-how-do-i-integrate-grain-with-pylon).

## Usage

New Grain calls will automatically get ingested and associated with the right account.

Grain calls will be used as data context for many Pylon features like [Ask AI](/pylon-docs/platform/ask-ai), [Account Copilot](/pylon-docs/account-intelligence/accounts/copilot), and [Account Blocks](/pylon-docs/account-intelligence/notebooks/blocks) and be visible on the activity timeline for accounts and related issues.
