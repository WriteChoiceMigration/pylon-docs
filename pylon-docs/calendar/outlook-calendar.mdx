## Setup

A Pylon Admin must enable the integration in the [Apps Directory](https://app.usepylon.com/apps) by selecting the Outlook Calendar tile and clicking on "Connect." Once the integration is enabled for the workspace, users can connect their personal calendars by navigating to the Apps Directory and selecting "Connect Outlook Calendar."

## Usage

Calendar events will start to backfill and two new custom fields will be available for use across the product: Next Meeting Date and Last Meeting Date. These fields can be used anywhere that [Custom Fields](/pylon-docs/platform/custom-fields) can be used, including in views, triggers, and more. They show up in  for accounts and are viewable in the account and issue sidebars.
