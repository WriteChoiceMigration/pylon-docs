## Setup

Go to the Triggers page under Settings to start creating triggers. Triggers will always be organized into a folder to help your team stay organized. Once you hit "create trigger" you'll have the option to select from various premade templates or start from scratch.

### Kickoffs

Every trigger is activated by change(s) in state for an Issue, Account, or Contact.

</Frame>

### Conditions

#### Filters

Narrow down the specific conditions of when this trigger should be executed by applying filters. Select from many default and custom attributes on issues, accounts, and contacts. The default logic is an "AND" operator meaning all criteria must be met, but you can also create more complex combinations of "AND" + "OR" by selecting "Create Filter Group" from the dropdown.

</Frame>

#### Time Delay

Time delay conditions allow you to delay the action taken based on either wall clock time or your defined support hours (i.e. setting SLA breaches to only count time passed during support hours).

</Frame>

#### AI

Use AI filters to intelligently route issues between teams or provide specific responses in specific situations.

</Frame>

### Actions

Pick from a set of actions to take when the conditions of the trigger are met. Chain many distinct actions together. Actions include sending notifications, auto-replying to issues, setting field values in Pylon, custom actions in external systems, and many more.

</Frame>


### Organization

Triggers are executed in order from top to bottom for a given kickoff event. You can separate triggers into groups for easier management.

</Frame>

### Recipes

Select from many pre-built templates of common automations.
