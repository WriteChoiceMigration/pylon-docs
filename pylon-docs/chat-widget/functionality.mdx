<Info>
You can always setup complex workflows using Pylon's [Triggers](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers) that apply to just chat, or across all your issues.

General support workflows like [CSAT](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/csat), [SLAs](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/slas), and [AI Support](/pylon-docs/ai-agents/overview) all can apply to Chat Widget as well.
</Info>

Within the chat configuration page, you can:

* Show different quick links to different users based on properties about them
* Hide or show the chat functionality to different users based on properties about them
* Hide or show the chat functionality when outside your support hours

### Embedded Knowledge Base

Allow users to search for and view knowledge base content directly inside your app.

</Frame>

### Embedded Forms

Embed your [Ticket Forms](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/ticket-forms) directly into your chat to allow users to submit async requests. Customize which tickets forms are visible to a user based on user or account properties.

### Sync & Respond from Slack

Set chats to sync to Slack, so you can view and respond to customer chats directly from Slack. This will bidirectionally sync messages, files, reactions, etc to and from the chat in real-time.

</Frame>

You can also have the chats sync directly to your shared channel with the customers. This allows their whole team to have visibility into questions being asked and your level of support ðŸ™‚
