## Commenting

Leave Google-docs style comments on articles to leave or request feedback on content.

In comments you can:

* Use rich text like bolds, italics, links, code, etc.
* Add attachments like images
* Tag other users on your team (and they'll receive a notification!)
* React to comments with emojis

</Frame>

You can click on the comment icon at the top of the doc to view historical comments that were already resolved.

## Collaborative Editing

Work on articles together in real-time. You'll be able to see an indicator in the editor if your teammates are editing content at the same time as you.
