## Articles

Articles each have their own URL with a customizable slug. For more information on writing articles, see the [Editor](/pylon-docs/knowledge-base/articles-and-collections/editor) section.

### Visibility

You have fine-grained control of the visibility of articles. Articles can be:

**Public**: Visible to everyone

**Customer**: Available to logged-in customers. You can optionally specify properties that viewers must meet to view the article. For example, specifying they must be on the Enterprise tier or part of a certain account can help you create articles tailored to only relevant segments of your customer base.

**Internal**: Only visible to users on your team (but not to AI Agents)

**AI Agent Only:** Visible to your team + AI Agents, but not visible to customers

Articles can also be set to be hidden -- this hides public/customer articles in the search for everyone but your team, but makes them accessible via a direct link. This is particularly useful for upcoming features that aren't released yet, or workarounds/setup that you don't want to draw too much attention to.

### Version History

Every time an article is published, it creates a new version. This allows you to review any changes made, or to revert to a historical version of the article at any time.

### Feedback

Articles by default come with embedded feedback collection. On the bottom of each article is a place for viewers to leave a 1-5 rating and free form feedback about the article.

You can view the submitted feedback in the "Performance" tab of the Knowledge Base configuration or set up Slack notifications for new feedback submissions in the Notifications tab.

## Collections

Collections are folders that contain articles or other collections. Each has their own URL, with options to customize the URL slug and icon for a collection on its settings page. You can also set visibility rules that will apply to all articles within that collection.

<Info>
You can create multiple separate knowledge bases by using articles and collections. This can be especially useful if you have different tiers of your product or well-defined sets of users with different product needs.
