Add external identifiers onto Pylon accounts so you can reference them with your own IDs. Especially useful to associate issues and contacts made from the [Chat Widget](/pylon-docs/chat-widget/overview) with the proper account.

For example, attach your own internal organization or customer identifier(s) onto accounts as external IDs.

See the [PATCH /accounts/{id}](/pylon-docs/developer/api/api-reference/accounts) endpoints for being able to set external IDs on accounts!
