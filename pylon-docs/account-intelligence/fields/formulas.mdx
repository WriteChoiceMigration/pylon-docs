With formulas, you have access to an array of manipulations and calculations you can perform on your data to create additional fields.

Formulas can have any data type available in [Custom Fields](/pylon-docs/platform/custom-fields), and are simply a calculation that is performed to fill in that data field. A formula field is usable across the product anywhere custom fields are, including in views, triggers, the API, etc.

### Example: Number of Meetings

For example, a formula to calculate the number of meetings you've had with a customer in the last 90 days.

</Frame>

### Example: Usage Percentage

Here is an example of using division on two synced fields to calculate seat utilization percentage.

<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="898" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/93f2abd4.png" width="1036"/>
</Frame>

### Example: Channel Members Left

The number of customer users who have left your channel in the last 30 days.

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="890" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/3156add8.png" width="1030"/>
</Frame>

### Example: Number of Feature Requests

The number of issues that are tied with engineering work (via. [Ticketing](/pylon-docs/integrations/ticketing) integrations).

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="938" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/069d060a.png" width="1036"/>
</Frame>

### Example: Lifecycle Stage

The stage of the customer (onboarding or renewal) based on their progress through the contract.

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="698" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/440441af.png" width="1028"/>
</Frame>

Examples of other formulas are:

* Calculating the number of issues that were categorized as bugs in the last 30 days
* Calculating the number of [Custom Activities](/pylon-docs/account-intelligence/activities/custom-activities) of a certain type that have occurred
* Creating a weighted health score across different components
