Create surveys on the [Surveys](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/surveys) page and preview how the survey looks in Slack, Email, Chat, and a Popup. Customize the wording of questions, coloring, notifications, who the survey is sent to and more.

Surveys come with:

* Customization on survey language, followup, and notifications

* Out-of-the-box analytics and raw results

* Audience and recurrence customization using triggers

* Live previews of what customers will see and ability to send yourself a preview

Use triggers to control the cadence and audience of your CSAT survey.
