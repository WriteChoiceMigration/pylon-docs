## Overview

Pylon’s Knowledge Base is designed to help you scale support, surface answers faster, and give both customers and internal teams the information they need—all in one place. Use it to:

* Document answers once and reuse them across workflows
* Enable customers to self-serve with accurate, searchable content
* Use [Copilot](/pylon-docs/knowledge-base/articles-and-collections/copilot) and [Knowledge Gaps](/pylon-docs/knowledge-base/knowledge-gaps) to AI draft content and identify common questions
* Build your support engine with [AI Agents](/pylon-docs/ai-agents/overview) reading from your knowledge base
* Centralize support, onboarding, and troubleshooting docs

## Use cases

* Public Help Center
    + Create a branded, SEO-optimized external knowledge base where users can search for help articles, FAQs, or onboarding content.
* Internal playbooks
    + Store escalation processes, troubleshooting guides, or policy documentation in internal-only articles your team can search.
* Generate articles with AI
    + Turn any issue resolution into a draft article with one click, then use AI to rewrite, summarize, or adjust tone before publishing.

* Gated Customer Content
    + Share specific documentation with customers based on login or account metadata, like implementation guides for enterprise users.
* Power AI
    + Use your content to power AI features across the product, like a [Copilot](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/issues/copilot) for your team or [Ask AI](/pylon-docs/platform/ask-ai).


## Best practices

* Use visibility settings intentionally
    + Choose between Public, Customer, Internal, or Unlisted visibility for each article to match the desired audience.

* Organize with collections
    + Nest articles in logical groupings using Collections to help users find content faster.
* Standardize formatting with templates
    + Keep formatting clean and consistent using article templates. When generating an article with AI, the AI will follow your template.
* Link articles with relative links
    + Use relative links between articles to reduce the risk of broken links when reorganizing.
* Federated search
    + In [Training Data](/pylon-docs/platform/training-data), connect your other documentation sources to get a federated[Search](/pylon-docs/knowledge-base/search) across all your data
