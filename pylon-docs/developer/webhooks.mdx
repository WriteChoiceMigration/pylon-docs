<Info>
Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events within Pylon.
</Info>

## Setup

1. Go to the [Webhooks](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/webhooks) page in Settings to setup your target endpoint
2. Specify the URL of your endpoint as well as any custom headers you'd like sent on each webhook. For example, here you can include authorization information like a Bearer token.
3. Go to [Triggers](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/triggers) in Settings and create a [Trigger](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers) with an Action of "Send webhook". Use the "When" and "If" condition of the trigger to control when the webhook fires.

Using templated variables, you can construct your desired webhook body to look exactly like how you'd like to receive it:
