The only setup needed is automatic forwarding from your support email to us.

1. Visit the [Settings Page](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/email) and go to the Email tab.
2. Set your support email(s) in the Receiving Email field.
3. Copy the email on the config page and follow the [google link instructions](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4524505#address-map-forwarding) to setup forwarding.
4. Click `Test` to verify that email forwarding is setup properly.

All done!
