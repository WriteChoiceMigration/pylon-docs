Issue groups introduce a parent-child relationship between issues and a new interface to manage the parent issue, including:

* Seeing all the associated child issues and being able to navigate to them
* Sending a bulk reply to all child issues, for example an outage resolution message
* When closing an issue group, optionally close all child issues at once.
