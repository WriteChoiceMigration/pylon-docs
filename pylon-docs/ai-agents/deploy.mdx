Consider your new AI agent as a member of your team. You can assign them to issues you'd like them to take a look at. This means you have full control of which customer issues your AI agent interacts with.

## Manual Assignment

You can also assign an individual issue to your AI agent, the same way you might normally assign an issue to a team member.

## Automated Assignment

You can use a feature like [Triggers](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers) to granularly scope which issues your AI agent interacts with.

As defined by your setup, if your AI agent is unable to answer a question, it will follow your escalation workflow and reassign the issue.
