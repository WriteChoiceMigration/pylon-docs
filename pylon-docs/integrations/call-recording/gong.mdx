## Setup

Click into the App Directory from your Pylon dashboard and then click on the Gong integration to view setup instructions. Make sure you are a Gong admin before clicking Connect. For more setup instructions, [see here](https://support.usepylon.com/articles/6926549735-how-do-i-integrate-gong-with-pylon).

## Usage

Historical Gong calls will automatically backfill into Pylon and new calls will automatically get ingested and associated with the right account.

Gong calls will be used as data context for many Pylon features like [Ask AI](/pylon-docs/platform/ask-ai), Account Copilot, and Account Widgets and be visible on the activity timeline for accounts and related issues.
