By default, authentication for your customers to access the customer portal is via a one-time passcode sent to their email on login.

Using Customer Authentication, you can implement unified login across the customer portal and your web application. This means when customers are logged in to your dashboard, they'll also seamlessly be logged into your Pylon customer portal (and knowledge base).
