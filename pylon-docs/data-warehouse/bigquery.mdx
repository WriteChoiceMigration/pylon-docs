## Setup

Head to the data warehouse [app section](https://app.usepylon.com/apps?category=data_warehouse) inside Pylon and connect the Big Query app.

<Info>
We recommend creating a new dataset to house your Pylon customer issue data. You can also create a new Project or use an existing one.
</Info>

Youâ€™ll need the following to configure your BigQuery connection:

1. **Key File JSON**

    Create a [service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) for your account and upload the JSON.

2. **Project ID**

    The ID of your project.

3. **Dataset ID**

    Create a [dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) where Pylon data will be housed.

4. **(Optional) Location**

    The [location](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations) in which the dataset is located.

5. **Table ID**

    The name of the table that data will be written to. Pylon will automatically create this table for you with the proper schema.

After you enter in these details, hit test to verify your connection!
