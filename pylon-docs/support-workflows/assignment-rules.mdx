As your team grows, assignment rules will allow you to make sure that issues are being handled by the right person.

## Setup

### Individual Assignment

Individual assignment rules can be setup using the "Set issue assignee" action in [Triggers](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers).

</Frame>

### Team Assignment

First create [Teams](/pylon-docs/platform/teams) that model groups of people. Then, create assignment strategies to automatically assign issues to individual members of a team. When an issue is assigned to a team, the individual owner of the issue can be determined by the team's assignment policy. There are additional options to make sure you assign issues based on current [User Status](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/assignment-rules/user-status).

</Frame>

#### Round Robin

Rotate between each team member equally when assigning issues.

#### Recurring

Set up a daily or weekly repeating schedule. Based on the time of day, issues that are assigned to a team will fall onto the appropriately individualâ€™s plate.

<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="596" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/3a785e6d.png" width="747"/>
</Frame>

### Usage

Put team assignment policies into affect by creating [Triggers](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers) that automatically assigns issues to a certain team.

<Frame>
<img alt="" class="block" data-testid="zoom-image" fetchpriority="low" height="84" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 400px, 768px" src="/images/a30189a0.png" width="822"/>

A recipe for a common workflow

You can setup any number of workflows to make sure issues get to the right people. Some examples might be:

* Routing high priority issues straight to Tier 3 support
* Routing bugs about a specific topic to the subject matter expert for that product area
* Reassigning issues that have had their SLA breached
* Routing pre-sales issues from important accounts to your sales engineering team
* Routing issues from named accounts to their CSM

<Info>
By creating subteams, you can effectively model complex assignment workflows, since each subteam can have its own assignment policy. If subteams are a part of a team assignment schedule, they will need an assignment policy set at the subteam level to work properly.
