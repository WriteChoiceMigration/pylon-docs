## Required Fields

Required fields must be filled in to save any change to an issue, from closing tickets to setting fields or assigning an issue. This is useful for making sure every issue is labeled for accurate analytics downstream as you grow your team.

## Visibility Conditions

Conditionally show (and require!) fields based on the values in another field. This is useful for showing extra fields to gather information in different conditions (i.e. different details are needed for bugs vs. feature requests). Visibility conditions can also be used to conditionally show nested fields, such as a Sub-Product Area that shows only when a Product Area is provided.
