With Pylonâ€™s support ticketing capabilities, your team and/or customers can initiate support tickets from Slack. Unlike conversations in Slack, a support ticket is visible to the customer with a status.

### Handoff Questions to the Support Team

If youâ€™re a CSM or Account Manager wasting time shuffling messages between a customer and support, you can seamlessly handoff support questions to the support team, directly from Slack.

### Allow Customers to stay in Slack

Donâ€™t force customers to leave Slack just to open a ticket. Make the workflow easy for your customers and your team!

### Have AI Link Documentation

Get support for your customer as quickly as possible when AI can link the relevant documentation.

## Opening a Ticket

### Customer Prompt

If enabled, when a customer sends a message that looks like a support question, weâ€™ll prompt them to self-serve into creating a support ticket automatically. The message they see can be customized on the [Settings Page](https://app.usepylon.com/settings/ticket-settings).

This message is only visible to the question asker and balances ongoing education with minimal intrusion.

### Closing a Ticket

Either your team or the customer can click the `Close Issue` button in Slack or the support team can close the ticket from Pylon.
