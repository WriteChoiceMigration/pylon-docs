## Overview

**Teams** in Pylon help you mirror your organizational structure so you can manage support and success workflows more effectively. They make it easier to:

* Divide responsibilities across functions, products, or regions

* Route and assign work using triggers and automation rules

* Track performance by team, subteam, or member

* Filter dashboards and views to focus on specific groups

* Report on volume, resolution time, and SLA adherence per team

Whether you’re managing enterprise customers, segmenting by region, or coordinating cross-functional work, Teams let you do it in a scalable, organized way.

## Use cases

* Assigning tickets by region
    + Route all EU tickets to the EMEA Support Team, with APAC getting their own queue and assignment logic.
* Organizing by function
    + Create separate teams for Support, Success, and Finance to triage different types of issues.
* Nested teams
    + Set up sub teams under broader teams (like Tier 1 and Tier 2 support under a Support team) for more detailed routing and reporting.
* Running global coverage
    + Use recurring daily/weekly schedules or round robin to distribute issues within a team automatically.


## Best practices

* Use Teams, even if you only have a small number of users, so you can be ready to scale
* Use Teams in [Triggers](/pylon-docs/platform/triggers) for automated routing (e.g. “Assign all emails to the support@ email address to the support team”)
* Create [Views](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/issues/views) filtered by Team to create targeted boards
* Report by Team to measure resolution times, volume, and performance
* Use [Assignment Rules](/pylon-docs/support-workflows/assignment-rules) to automatically route issues that have been assigned to a team to a specific individual on that team
