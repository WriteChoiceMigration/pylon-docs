## Setup

Click into the App Directory from your Pylon dashboard and then click on the Fathom integration to view setup instructions. Fathom will need to be connected to Pylon through Zapier, so you must also have a Zapier account. For more setup instructions, [see here](https://support.usepylon.com/articles/6926549735-how-do-i-integrate-gong-with-pylon).

## Usage

New Fathom calls will automatically get ingested and associated with the right account.

Fathom calls will be used as data context for many Pylon features like [Ask AI](/pylon-docs/platform/ask-ai), Account Copilot, and Account Widgets and be visible on the activity timeline for accounts and related issues.
