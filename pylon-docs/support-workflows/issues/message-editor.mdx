The editor supports all forms of rich text, including:

* Bolding, italics, strikethrough, and links
* Inline code and multiline code blocks
* Emojis
* Mentions of teammates or customers
* Attachments

## Macros

Through the editor, you can also run [Macros](/pylon-docs/platform/macros) by clicking the âš¡ icon in the text formatting toolbar or with the `m` keyboard shortcut. A macro can add templated pre-filled texted into the editor and also queue up a series of actions to be executed.

## Internal Note

Selecting `Note` indicates that the message will not be visible to the customer. Depending on your configured settings and integrations, the message will either only be visible in Pylon, or be visible in Pylon and posted to the issue thread in your [Internal Threads](/pylon-docs/integrations/chat/slack/editor).

## Scheduled Messages

Clicking the arrow next to the send button allows you to schedule replies and notes for the future. The time shown is in the time zone you have configured in your profile.

Scheduled messages are visible to all team members even before they're sent, and can be edited or canceled. You can find all your scheduled messages from the "Scheduled" view at the bottom of your Issues list in the left sidebar.
